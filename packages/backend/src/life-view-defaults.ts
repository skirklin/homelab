/**
 * The default Views, default View-tracked vocab, and default notifications that
 * reproduce TODAY'S three code-defined sessions (morning / evening / weekly)
 * EXACTLY as data. These are the `DEFAULT_*` fallbacks the `useViews` /
 * `useNotifications` resolvers return when a log's `manifest.views` /
 * `manifest.notifications` is `undefined` (legacy / un-customized logs).
 *
 * Phase B1 is FULLY ADDITIVE: nothing here is rendered or scheduled yet. The
 * ViewRunner consumes `DEFAULT_VIEWS` in Phase B2; the notification cron
 * consumes `DEFAULT_NOTIFICATIONS` in Phase B4. The Phase-C migration
 * materializes `DEFAULT_VIEW_TRACKABLES` into each log's `manifest.trackables`.
 *
 * Source of truth for the prompt text / order / placeholders below is today's
 * `apps/life/app/src/manifest.ts` `SESSIONS` array — kept byte-faithful so the
 * eventual data-driven renderer reproduces the wizards verbatim.
 *
 * ── The split-collision id map (design §3) ──────────────────────────────────
 * Today's session prompts collide on `entries[].name` across sessions
 * (morning.intention vs weekly.intention; evening.lesson vs weekly.lesson). As
 * distinct VOCAB ids they must split, so each gets its own `subject_id` series:
 *
 *   morning.gratitude          → gratitude          (noted)
 *   morning.intention          → daily_intention    (noted)  [split]
 *   morning.energy             → energy             (rated)
 *   evening.intention_followup → intention_followup (noted, refs daily_intention)
 *   evening.win                → daily_win          (noted)
 *   evening.lesson             → daily_lesson       (noted)  [split]
 *   weekly.highlights          → highlights         (noted)
 *   weekly.lows                → lows               (noted)
 *   weekly.lesson              → weekly_lesson      (noted)  [split]
 *   weekly.intention           → weekly_intention   (noted)  [split]

 *
 * This is now an INERT fallback only: `useNotifications` resolves an
 * `undefined` `manifest.notifications` to this default so an editor never
 * renders blank. New logs seed `manifest.notifications: []` (see
 * life-manifest-default.ts) and every existing log was materialized with a real
 * array by the Phase D column→manifest migration, so the cron never relies on
 * this — `resolveNotifications` reads `manifest.notifications` and falls back to
 * `[]`, not to these defaults.
 *
 * Historical note: these BARE ids (`morning`/`evening`/`weekly`) deliberately
 * differ from the `*-reminder` ids the Phase D migration materialized (which
 * key `reminder_state`); the migration used the migration-time
 * column-reconstruction, never this default. (Cross-ref: `LifeManifest.notifications`
 * doc in `packages/backend/src/types/life.ts`.)
